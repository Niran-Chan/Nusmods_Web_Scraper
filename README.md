# Module Context Web Scraper

## Introduction
I made this tool in hopes of helping those that are super lazy in individually copy-pasting every module they did to a word file, formatting it, then hoping they didn't miss anything. If this is you, congratulations. Your laziness is very much approved.

## Installation
In the working directory, create a virtual environment:

```virtualenv .```

Install the required modules:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

Open up ```webscraper.py``` and enter the modules that you are required to search for. The ones provided are mine. Feel free to change them.

That's it!
